# ðŸš– NYC For-Hire Vehicle Base Fare Prediction

> **Portfolio Project**: Combining advanced machine learning with stakeholder-focused insights to predict and optimize NYC For-Hire Vehicle (FHV) base fares.

---

## ðŸŒŸ Project Highlights
- **End-to-End ML Pipeline**: Data ingestion â†’ feature engineering â†’ model training â†’ prediction.  
- **Stakeholder Value**: Enables operators to forecast base fares, optimize pricing, and assess revenue opportunities.  
- **Scalable on Microsoft Fabric**: Built natively on Fabricâ€™s **Lakehouse + Spark + Delta** ecosystem for reproducibility.  
- **Interdisciplinary**: Bridges *statistical rigor* and *business impact*.

## ðŸš€ Workflow
1. **EDA & Feature Engineering**  
   - Explored ride patterns (airport trips, tolls, tips, congestion surcharge).  
   - Engineered new features to capture demand & cost drivers.  

2. **Model Training & Evaluation**  
   - Built regression & ensemble models.  
   - Benchmarked with **RÂ²**, **RMSE**, and **MAE**.  

3. **Predictions on New Data**  
   - Applied trained model to unseen ride records.  
   - Produced predicted base fares with confidence intervals.

## ðŸ“Š Results (Technical)
- Best-performing model: **[insert model name here]**  
- Achieved **RÂ² = X.XX**, **RMSE = Y.YY**, **MAE = Z.ZZ**.  
- Outperformed baseline regression benchmarks.  

---

## ðŸ’¼ Business Impact (Stakeholder Lens)
- **Revenue Forecasting**: Provides operators foresight into trip-level base fare revenues.  
- **Pricing Strategy**: Identifies sensitivity to congestion charges, tolls, and ride flags.  
- **Operational Planning**: Helps in segmenting trips (airport vs. city) for optimized allocation.  
- **Decision Enablement**: Demonstrates how AI/ML insights can be embedded into financial planning.
