# ü§ù Contributing to NYC FHV Base Fare Prediction

> Thank you for your interest in contributing!  
> This repository represents a complete, end-to-end **data science and BI engineering workflow** ‚Äî from raw NYC FHV parquet datasets to an enterprise-ready Power BI experience.

We welcome meaningful contributions that strengthen **data quality**, **model robustness**, **reproducibility**, or **visual storytelling**.  
Whether you‚Äôre improving PySpark transformations, refining LightGBM parameters, or enhancing documentation ‚Äî your contribution is valued.

## üß≠ Guiding Principles

1. **Data Integrity First**  
   All data transformations must preserve logical and statistical consistency.  

2. **Clarity Over Cleverness**  
   Write code that others can read and extend ‚Äî even under time pressure.  

3. **Reproducibility**  
   Any contributor should be able to reproduce your results using the documented environment.  

4. **Transparency**  
   Document every major decision in commits, PR descriptions, or markdown notes.

## üßÆ Pull Request Guidelines

- Keep PRs focused and descriptive.  
- Include a short summary of your changes in the PR body.  
- If applicable, add screenshots or sample outputs.  
- Ensure all notebooks run cleanly from top to bottom without manual intervention.  

---

## üß∞ Coding Standards

- Follow **PEP8** for Python style.  
- Use **snake_case** for variables and **PascalCase** for classes.  
- Avoid hard-coded file paths ‚Äî prefer environment variables or config files.  
- Add inline comments to clarify complex logic.  

---

## üß™ Testing & Validation

Before submitting a PR:  
1. Run all transformation and modeling notebooks end-to-end.  
2. Validate that model evaluation metrics (RMSE, R¬≤) remain within expected thresholds.  
3. Ensure Power BI outputs are unaffected or improved.
