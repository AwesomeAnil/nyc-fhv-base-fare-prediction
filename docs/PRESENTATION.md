# üöñ NYC FHV Base Fare Prediction

---

## üéØ Business Problem

NYC High-Volume For Hire (FHV) operators and regulators face several challenges:

* **Pricing Transparency**: Ensuring riders are charged fair, consistent fares.
* **Revenue Forecasting**: Estimating base fare revenues for financial planning.
* **Regulatory Compliance**: Supporting NYC TLC reporting obligations.
* **Fraud Detection**: Identifying anomalous trips with inflated or under-reported fares.
* **Operational Strategy**: Segmenting trips (airport vs. city, shared vs. solo) to optimize allocation and profitability.

**Goal:** Build a **predictive model** for base fares that delivers accurate, explainable insights.

## üìä Data & EDA Overview

**Source**: NYC TLC High-Volume FHV Trip Records.
**Features analyzed**:

* base_passenger_fare
   - Mean: $27.55
   - Median: $19.99
   - Min/Max: $6.19 ‚Äì $129.90
   - Std Dev: 22.73
   - IQR: 12.67 ‚Äì 33.57
   - Fare distribution is right-skewed with many low-to-mid fares and some high fares inflating the mean. Typical fares are between $12‚Äì$34
* driver_pay_per_mile
   - Mean: 5.54
   - Median: 4.91
   - Min/Max: 2.44 ‚Äì 18.30
   - Std Dev: 2.69
   - IQR: 3.84 ‚Äì 6.30
   - Most trips have driver pay around $4‚Äì$6 per mile. Some trips have extremely high pay rates (up to 18.3), creating right-skewness.
* trip_miles
   - Mean: 5.00 miles
   - Median: 3.03 miles
   - Min/Max: 0.48 ‚Äì 27.69 miles
   - Std Dev: 5.20
   - IQR: 1.56 ‚Äì 6.42 miles
   - Most trips are short to moderate distance. The median is lower than the mean, indicating a right-skewed distribution with some long trips (up to 27.69 miles) driving the mean upward.
* Trip time:
  - Mean: 1209.28 minutes (~20 hours ‚Äì seems unusually high; likely units issue or aggregated trips)
  - Median: 978 minutes (~16 hours)
  - Min/Max: 194 ‚Äì 4459 minutes (~3 hours to 74 hours)
  - Std Dev: 846.95
  - IQR: 600 ‚Äì 1566 minutes
  - There is very high variability in trip times. Right-skewed with extreme maximum values. Most trips are under 26 hours (75th percentile). There may be outliers or data entry issues, given unusually long times.
 * Tolls:
   - Mean: 1.07
   - Median: 0.00
   - Min/Max: 0.00 ‚Äì 18.52
   - Std Dev: 3.34
   - IQR: 0.00 ‚Äì 0.00
   - Most trips do not include tolls (median = 0), but some trips incur very high tolls, creating a heavily right-skewed distribution.
 * Congestion surcharge:
   - Mean: 0.97
   - Median: 0.00
   - Min/Max: 0.00 ‚Äì 2.75
   - Std Dev: 1.31
   - IQR: 0.00 ‚Äì 2.75
   - Many trips do not incur congestion charges (median = 0), but some trips have high surcharges, indicating right-skew.
 * Airport fee:
   - Mean: 0.22
   - median: 0.00
   - Min/Max: 0.00 ‚Äì 2.50
   - Std Dev: 0.71
   - IQR: 0.00 ‚Äì 0.00
   - Most trips do not include airport fees, but a few trips have substantial fees. Highly right-skewed.
 * Tips:
   - Mean: 1.16
   - Median: 0.00
   - Min/Max: 0.00 ‚Äì 18.03
   - Std Dev: 3.11
   - IQR: 0.00 ‚Äì 0.00
   - Most passengers do not tip, but the tip distribution has a long right tail with some high tipping trips.

## üîç Univariate Analysis (Base Passenger Fares)

* **Trip Time**: Right-skewed distribution; capped extreme outliers.
* **Tips**: Long-tail distribution; majority trips with minimal tips, few with very high.
* **Tolls & Surcharges**: Step-like distributions reflecting NYC pricing rules.
* **Driver Pay**: Concentrated around specific bands; indicative of standardized trip categories.

## üîó Bivariate Analysis (Examples)

* **Trip Time vs. Base Fare**: Positive correlation; non-linear at higher durations.
* **Airport Trips vs. Base Fare**: Airport flag strongly associated with higher base fare.
* **Congestion Surcharge vs. Fare**: Distinct fare lift observed with surcharge applied.
* **Shared Ride vs. Fare**: Shared-match flag linked to slightly reduced fares.
