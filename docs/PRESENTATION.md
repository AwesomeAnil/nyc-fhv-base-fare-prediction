# üöñ NYC FHV Base Fare Prediction

---

## üéØ Business Problem

NYC High-Volume For Hire (FHV) operators and regulators face several challenges:

* **Pricing Transparency**: Ensuring riders are charged fair, consistent fares.
* **Revenue Forecasting**: Estimating base fare revenues for financial planning.
* **Regulatory Compliance**: Supporting NYC TLC reporting obligations.
* **Fraud Detection**: Identifying anomalous trips with inflated or under-reported fares.
* **Operational Strategy**: Segmenting trips (airport vs. city, shared vs. solo) to optimize allocation and profitability.

**Goal:** Build a **predictive model** for base fares that delivers accurate, explainable insights.

## üìä Data & EDA Overview

* **Source**: NYC TLC High-Volume FHV Trip Records.
* **Features analyzed**:

  * Trip time
  * Tolls
  * Congestion surcharge
  * Airport fee
  * Tips
  * Flags (shared ride, airport, access-a-ride)

---

## üîç Univariate Analysis (Examples)

* **Trip Time**: Right-skewed distribution; capped extreme outliers.
* **Tips**: Long-tail distribution; majority trips with minimal tips, few with very high.
* **Tolls & Surcharges**: Step-like distributions reflecting NYC pricing rules.
* **Driver Pay**: Concentrated around specific bands; indicative of standardized trip categories.

---

## üîó Bivariate Analysis (Examples)

* **Trip Time vs. Base Fare**: Positive correlation; non-linear at higher durations.
* **Airport Trips vs. Base Fare**: Airport flag strongly associated with higher base fare.
* **Congestion Surcharge vs. Fare**: Distinct fare lift observed with surcharge applied.
* **Shared Ride vs. Fare**: Shared-match flag linked to slightly reduced fares.

## üõ† Feature Engineering

* Derived binary flags: `airport_flag`, `shared_match`, `access_a_ride`.
* Log transformations to normalize skewed variables (trip time, tips).
* Standard scaling applied to all numeric features.
* Interaction terms (e.g., `trip_time √ó congestion_surcharge`).

## ü§ñ Modeling

**Algorithm Used:** Linear Regression (Statsmodels OLS)

**Model Fit:**

* **R¬≤ = 0.954** ‚Üí Explains **95.4% of variance** in base passenger fares.
* **F-statistic = 3.31e+06, p < 0.001** ‚Üí Model highly significant.
* **Durbin-Watson ‚âà 2.00** ‚Üí Residuals show no autocorrelation.
* **Sample size (N = 1,600,000)** ‚Üí Results are robust and generalizable.
